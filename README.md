# Obsidian-File-Server

HTTPS file server to sync Obsidian vaults between multiple devices. I am working on an Obsidian plugin to interface with the server from the Obsidian desktop and mobile apps.

The server is built using Python Flask, and I have also made a simple console-based app to test the server's functionality.

The program can be repurposed to store any files.
